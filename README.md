# AllergyExtension

In this Google Chrome extension, we have developed a way for users to quickly locate if there are allergens present in the food they are purchasing online. With online shopping for groceries, it can be challenging to locate where the ingredients are located on a website. This user-friendly extension allows users to search through websites for multiple allergens that may be present when online grocery shopping.

This extension was developed in a way to promote equity, diversity, and inclusion, especially in the food space. With the tool that we have created, it provides an opportunity for people who may have a lot of allergies to safetly shop for groceries online or to be informed of allergens on food recipe websites.

The Allergy Extension was developed in VS Code using the computer programming lanuages, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
